# Docs for Fourier Builder

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Reference Generation

We use python script `./tools/refgen.py` to generate reference files for the API documentation. To generate the reference files, run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 ./tools/refgen.py
```

This command will generate the reference files in the `./docs/99-reference/nodes` directory. Before generation, the script will clean the contents of the directory, so make sure to backup any files you want to keep.

Please note the presence of the `nodes.json` and `categories.json` files in the tools directory. These files are crucial for generating the API documentation page. The `nodes.json` file contains detailed information about all the nodes, while the `categories.json` file organizes the information into relevant categories. The `refgen.py` script uses these data files to generate the comprehensive reference files needed for the documentation.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on GitHub pages. To deploy the website, run the following command:

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
