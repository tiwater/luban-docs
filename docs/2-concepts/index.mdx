# Basic Concepts

## Node

Node is the basic building block of a workflow. It is a single step in the workflow that performs a specific task. Nodes can be connected to each other to create a workflow.

Each node has an input and an output. The input of a node is the data that is passed to the node, and the output of a node is the data that is produced by the node.

Node has attributes that can be configured to customize the behavior of the node. For example, a function node has a function attribute that can be configured to specify the function that the node will execute.

## Edge

Edge is a connection between two nodes. It is used to connect the output of one node to the input of another node. Edges define the flow of data in the workflow.

## Workflow

Workflow is a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other. It is a series of steps that are executed in a specific order to perform a specific task.

Workflow can be built in Fourier Builder and deployed to a robot to perform the task. It can be used to automate a process, perform data processing, or control a robot.

## Project

Project is the unit of organizing workflows. It is a collection of workflows that are related to each other. Projects can be used to group workflows that are related to each other, for example, workflows that are part of the same application.

## Template

You can publish a workflow as a template. A template is a reusable workflow that can be used as a starting point for creating new workflows. Templates can be shared with others, and they can be used to create new workflows quickly.
