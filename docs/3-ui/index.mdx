The Fourier Builder UI is divided into several sections:

1. **Toolbar**: The toolbar contains buttons for common actions like saving, deploying, and running workflows.
2. **Workflow Editor**: The workflow editor is where you can build and edit your workflows.
3. **Node Palette**: The node palette contains all the nodes you can use to build your workflow.
4. **Properties Panel**: The properties panel displays the properties of the currently selected node.
5. **Console**: The console displays logs and errors generated by the workflow.

## Node Pane

## Simulation Panel

The simulation panel is where you can view the simulation of the robot. You can see the robot moving and interacting with the environment in the simulation panel.

## Canvas

The workflow editor is where you can build and edit your workflows. You can drag and drop nodes from the node palette onto the canvas to create a workflow. You can connect nodes by dragging an edge from the output of one node to the input of another node.

## Toolbar

The toolbar contains buttons for common actions like saving, deploying, and running workflows. You can save your workflow by clicking the save button. You can deploy your workflow to a robot by clicking the deploy button. You can run your workflow by clicking the run button.
