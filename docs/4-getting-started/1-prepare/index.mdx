# Prepare Environment

Before you start building your workflow, you need to prepare the environment. This includes setting up the Fourier Builder account, preparing the robot environment to run the project.

## Register Account

Even though we can browse the samples without login, to save your work, you need to register a user account.

1. Go to [Fourier Builder](https://builder.fftai.dev/).
2. Click the Sign In button at the top right corner.
2. Click on the "Register now" button at the bottom of the sign in form.
3. Fill in the form and click on the "Register" button.

## Prepare Robot

The ultimate goal is to run the workflow on a robot. To achieve this, you need to prepare the robot environment. Previously, deploying and running the code on a robot is a complicated process. Fourier Builder simplifies this process by providing a visual programming interface to build the workflow and deploy it to the robot.

### Robot Simulation

If you do not have access to a Fourier robot, you can use the simulation environment to test your workflow. This simulation mimics the behavior of a real robot, allowing you to validate your workflow before deploying it to physical hardware.

### Get a Real Robot

To execute workflows on a real robot, you need a Fourier humanoid robot. For more information on obtaining a Fourier robot, please refer to the [official Fourier Intelligence website](https://fourierintelligence.com/).

### Supported Robots

Currently, Fourier Builder supports the following robots:
- **GR-1**

More robots will be supported in future updates, ensuring compatibility with various models as they are released.
