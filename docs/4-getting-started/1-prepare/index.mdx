# Prepare Environment

Before you start, you need to prepare the environment.

1. A working Fourier robot with a camera and a microphone.

## Register Account

Even though we can browse the samples without login, to save your work, you need to register a user account.

1. Go to [Fourier Builder](https://builder.fourier-studio.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign Up" button.
3. Fill in the form and click on the "Sign Up" button.

## Simulation Environment

If you don't have a Fourier robot, you can use the simulation environment to test the workflow.

## Install a Fourier Robot

To run the workflow on a real robot, you need to get a Fourier humanoid robot in place. Please refer to the [official website](https://fourierintelligence.com/) for more information.
