# New Project

Creating a new workflow from a template is the easiest way to start the build process. This approach provides you with a pre-configured workflow containing all the necessary steps and variables to get your project up and running.

In this tutorial, we will create a blank project to demonstrate the process of building a workflow from scratch.

You can create a new project in Fourier Builder through two simple methods:

1. From the Home Page:

  * Navigate to the home page of the Fourier Builder UI.
  * Click the New Project button.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll have a new project ready to customize and build your workflow.
