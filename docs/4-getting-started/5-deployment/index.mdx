# Deploy to Robot

We have successfully built a workflow that controls the robot to move forward and backward, and tested it in the simulation environment. In this section, we will deploy the workflow to the robot and run it in the production environment.

## Deploy Workflow

To deploy the workflow to the robot, follow these steps:

1. **Save Workflow**: Click the `Save` button to save the workflow.
2. **Deploy Workflow**: Click the `Deploy` button to deploy the workflow to the robot. The workflow will be uploaded to the robot and stored in its memory.

## Run Workflow on Robot

After deploying the workflow to the robot, you can run it in the production environment. Follow these steps to run the workflow on the robot:

1. **Connect to Robot**: Make sure the robot is connected to the network and accessible from Fourier Builder.
2. **Run Workflow**: Click the `Run` button to run the workflow on the robot. The robot will start moving forward and backward as expected.

## Monitor the Workflow

While the workflow is running on the robot, you can monitor its progress and status from Fourier Builder. The `Simulation Pane` displays the robot's movements in real-time, allowing you to see how the robot is performing the tasks.
