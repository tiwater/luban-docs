# Deploy to Robot

We have successfully built a workflow that controls the robot to move forward and backward, and tested it in the simulation environment. In this section, we will deploy the workflow to the robot and run it in the production environment.

## Run Workflow

To run the workflow on the robot, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Network**: According to the robot’s manual, connect the robot to a Wi-Fi network with Internet access. Ensure the robot’s hotspot (e.g., gr1p24ja0027, refer to the robot’s serial number) is enabled and can connect to the Internet.
2. **Initialize the Robot**: Follow the robot’s manual to initialize the limbs using pad or other tools, and ensure the robot is standing steadily on the ground.
3. **Access Fourier Builder**: Connect your computer to the robot’s hotspot and access http://192.168.12.1:3000 via a browser to open the robot’s local Fourier Builder.
4. **Sync Workflow**: Log into Fourier Builder using your previously registered account. After a short wait, your previously created projects will sync to the robot. Select the project you want to execute from "My Projects". If you cannot access the Internet for security or technical reasons, you won’t be able to sync cloud workflows, and you will have to create and run workflows locally. Many cloud-dependent features will also be unavailable.
5. **Run Workflow**: Click the `Run` button to run the workflow on the robot. The robot will start working as expected.

## Deploy Workflow to Robot

`Run` the workflow on the robot is a one-time action—the robot will forget the executed program after it finishes. To make the workflow run permanently on the robot, you need to deploy it. Follow these steps to deploy the workflow to the robot:

1. Perform steps 1-5 as in the previous section.
2. **Deploy Workflow**: Click the `Deploy` button to upload and store the workflow in the robot’s memory.
3. **Run Workflow**: Open the graphical programming interface on the pad, where you can see all the deployed projects on the robot. Click the Start button next to the project you wish to execute to run the workflow. You can thereafter use the pad to run deployed workflows on the robot.
