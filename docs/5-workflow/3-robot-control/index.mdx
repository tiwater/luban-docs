# Robot Control

We provide a set of feature-rich nodes to control the robot in different granularities.

## Motor Control

This is the low level control in correspondence with the functions exposed from Robot SDK. Because each robot action usually involves multiple motors, we provide a set of nodes to control the motors in different ways. Use the low level features in incorrect might cause damage to the robot or the environment.

To use the low level control, you need to know the motor ID and the motor value range.
