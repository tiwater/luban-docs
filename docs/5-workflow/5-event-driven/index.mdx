# Events

Events are a way to trigger a workflow based on a specific condition. For example, you can trigger a workflow when a new file is uploaded to a specific folder, or when a new message is posted in a Slack channel.

## Event-Driven Model

If we look at how humans work, we can see that we are event-driven. We react to events that happen around us. For example, when we receive a message, we react to it by reading it and responding to it. When we receive a phone call, we react to it by answering it. When we receive an email, we react to it by reading it and responding to it.

Other than events that happen around us, we also have internal events. For example, when we are hungry, we react to it by eating. When we are tired, we react to it by sleeping.

The event-driven model is a way to model how humans work. It is a way to model how we react to events that happen around us and how we react to internal events.

## Event-Driven Workflow

In Fourier Builder, you can create an event-driven workflow by using the event nodes. The event nodes are used to trigger a workflow based on a specific condition. For example, you can trigger a workflow when a new file is uploaded to a specific folder, or when a new message is posted in a Slack channel.

The event nodes are used to listen for events and trigger a workflow when the event occurs. The event nodes can listen for events from various sources, such as a file system, a database, a message queue, or a web service.

The event nodes can be used to trigger a workflow based on various conditions. For example, you can trigger a workflow when a new file is uploaded to a specific folder, or when a new message is posted in a Slack channel.

The event nodes can also be used to trigger a workflow based on a schedule. For example, you can trigger a workflow every hour, every day, or every week.

## Event Nodes

The event nodes in Fourier Builder provide a variety of functions to listen for events and trigger a workflow when the event occurs. The event nodes can listen for events from various sources, such as a file system, a database, a message queue, or a web service.

The event nodes can be used to trigger a workflow based on various conditions. For example, you can trigger a workflow when a new file is uploaded to a specific folder, or when a new message is posted in a Slack channel.
