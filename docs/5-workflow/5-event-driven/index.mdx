# Events

Events are used to trigger workflows based on specific conditions. For example, workflows can be triggered when a new file is uploaded to a specific folder, or when a new message is posted in a Slack channel.

## Event-Driven Model

Humans operate in an event-driven manner. We react to external events such as messages, phone calls, and emails by reading and responding to them. Similarly, we respond to internal events; for instance, we eat when hungry and sleep when tired. The event-driven model mimics this reactive behavior by responding to both external and internal events.

## Event-Driven Workflow

In Fourier Builder, creating an event-driven workflow involves using event nodes. These nodes listen for specific conditions and trigger workflows accordingly. For example, they can initiate workflows when a joystick is moved or when voice commands are detected.

Event nodes can monitor events from sources such as joystick, voice, and vision. They can also be set to trigger workflows based on scheduled times.

## Event Nodes

Fourier Builder's event nodes provide extensive functionality to detect events and initiate workflows. The current event-driven model, however, supports only joystick, voice, and vision events. Other event types are not supported at this time.

Event nodes can listen for specific conditions to trigger workflows and can also be scheduled to activate workflows at regular intervals. This flexibility allows for a wide range of automation possibilities tailored to specific needs and workflows.
