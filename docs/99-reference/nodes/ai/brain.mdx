| **System Context** | text | Global instructions for the LLM that remain continuously in effect. |
| **Model** | text | Model to be used |
| **Available Actions** | json | Defines the actions supported by the robot |
| **Enable Knowledge Base** | boolean | Allow the robot to query the knowledge base before responding to the user. |
| **Knowledge Base Context** | text | ```json
"Global instructions for how the LLM should handle information retrieved from the knowledge base. Provided to the LLM immediately following the System Context. The &#123;&#123;knowledge&#125;&#125; tag within this text will be replaced with the content retrieved from the knowledge base."
``` |
| **Knowledge Base** | text | Knowledge base to query |
| **Temperature** | number | Controls the randomness of the output content |

"Variable name of the event queue. The format for action events is: \n&#123;\n\"name\":\"ACTION\",\n\"timestamp\": number,\n\"parameters\":&#123;\nPARAMETERS_DEPENDS_ON_ACTION\n&#125;&#125;.\nThe timestamp is the time when the request was initiated.
