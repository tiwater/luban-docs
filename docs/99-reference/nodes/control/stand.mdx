# Stand

**Description**: Use this function to make the robot stand up from a resting position or other positions. Once you've called start() and waited for stabilization, go ahead and use stand() to get the robot into a standing position. Only after making the stand() call can you then give further control commands or motion instructions. If the robot is walking or in the middle of other movements, you can also use this function to bring it to a stop

**Type**: robot
