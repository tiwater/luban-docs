# Logic Control

Logic control nodes are used to control the flow of the program. These nodes allow you to create conditional statements, loops, and other control structures to manage the execution of your program.

## Conditional

The `Conditional` node is used to create conditional statements in your program. You can use this node to check if a condition is true or false and execute different branches of the program based on the result.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Condition | The condition to check. |
| True | The branch to execute if the condition is true. |
| False | The branch to execute if the condition is false. |

## Loop

The `Loop` node is used to create loops in your program. You can use this node to repeat a set of actions a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Count | The number of times to repeat the loop. |
| Condition | The condition to check before each iteration. |
| Body | The actions to repeat. |

## Break

The `Break` node is used to exit a loop. You can use this node to break out of a loop before it reaches the end.

## Continue

The `Continue` node is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. You can use this node to skip over certain iterations of a loop based on a condition.

## Return

The `Return` node is used to exit a function. You can use this node to return a value from a function and stop its execution.
