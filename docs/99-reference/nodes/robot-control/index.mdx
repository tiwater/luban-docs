# Robot Control

We provide a set of nodes for controlling the robot. These nodes are divided into two categories: high-level control and low-level control.

## Robot Control

High-level control nodes are used to control the robot at a higher level. For example, you can use the `MoveTo` node to move the robot to a specific location.

| Node Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| MoveTo | Move the robot to a specific location. |

## Motor Control

Low-level control nodes are used to control the robot at a lower level. For example, you can use the `SetJointPosition` node to set the joint position of the robot.

The features of low-level control nodes are relevant to the features exposed by the robot's SDK. If you want to use these nodes, you need to install the SDK of the robot.
